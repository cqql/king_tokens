KingTokens
=========
Tokens are a usefull way to give users access to an application. This can be for a limited time or just once.
Just think of password resets, changing email, protected rss feed urls, timed out private links, ..

KingTokens map polymorphic to other objects, through the can_has_tokens :whatever_name call


The code and the docs need some more love, until than read the tests and check coverage report in coverage/index.html



Example
=======

class User
  can_has_tokens :forgot_password
end


class UsersController

  def lost_password
    # form with email so user can send himself a password reset link
    if request.post?
     	...
        #create users forgot_password_token
        @user.set_forgot_password_token
        .....
    end
  end

  #if user is found by lost_pass_code, send him to his password_edit page
  def change_password
    ...
    # identify by forgot_password_token in params[:code]
    user = User.find_by_valid_token(:forgot_password,  params[:code])
    user.get_forgot_password_token.use!
    ...
  end
  

end

Methods added:
  user.set_forgot_password_token  => set a new token and removing any existing one
  user.get_forgot_password_token  => returns the token object
  user.forgot_password_token      => returns the token string
  user.forgot_password_token?     => true if the user has such a token
